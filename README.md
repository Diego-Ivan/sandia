# Sandia

Yet another To Do list application. Organize your pending tasks. It's far from usable right now, there's not even a proper sidebar.

## To Do list: 

### UI

- [x] First Mock-ups for the sidebar
- [x] First Mock-ups for the task page
- [x] First Mock-ups for the task row
- [ ] Use the sidebar as and stack switcher
- [ ] Create lists
- [ ] Choose an emoji (or a color?) for the lists
- [ ] Delete Lists
- [ ] Send tasks to trash
- [ ] Edit details window for a task (Reconsider changing the window for a GNOME To Do like pattern)
- [ ] Hide Completed tasks (a no-tasks page maybe?)
- [ ] Show completed tasks
- [ ] Order tasks in due date order
- [ ] Todoist-like projects
